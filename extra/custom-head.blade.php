| Custom assets
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Custom assets are stored in the 'custom-assets' directory found inside the 'extra' folder.
Custom assets can be any file you would like to use in your theme.
For example: JS, CSS or image files.

You can load these custom assets with a built-in function, 'themeAsset()'.
Add the file you want to add to your 'custom-assets' folder, and include the name with the file extension in the function.

Down below, you can find a few examples using this function:



--}}

<style> 
@font-face{font-family:'Raleway';src:url('{{themeAsset('Raleway-VariableFont_wght.ttf')}}')}
</style>
